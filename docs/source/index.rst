cmpitool documentation
=================================================

Welcome to the documention of the cmpitool. Cmpitool is a simple python library that calculated climate model performance indices after Reichler and Kim (2008) <https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-89-3-303>`. It does so while using a large set of 30 CMPI6 model simulations and the latest observational dataset for up to 14 variables, 21 regions, and 4 seasons.
