    DESCRIPTION:
    This function calculates the pointwise absolute error and the mean absolute error 
    between your model(s) and the observational data. It does so separatly for each
    model, region, season, variable and optionally depth.
    
    INPUT:
    abs_error		        Ordered dictionary containing fields of absolute error
                                between model and obs data
    mean_error                  Ordered dictionary containing fields area weighted mean
                                of abs_error
    models                      List of models to be evaluated
    regions                     List of regions to be evaluated
    seasons                     List of seasons to be evaluated
    out_path                    Path to folder containing absolute error csv files
    verbose                     Boolean for verbose output
