"""Top-level package for cmpitool.

CMPITool (Climate Model Performance Indexing Tool) is a Python framework for
evaluating and comparing climate models against observational data and other
reference models.

The tool calculates performance indices based on the methodology of Reichler and Kim (2008),
comparing model outputs to observational data across multiple variables, regions, and seasons.

Key Features:
- Evaluation of climate models against observations
- Comparison against reference models (default: 30 CMIP6 models)  
- Analysis of multiple climate variables (temperature, precipitation, winds, etc.)
- Regional and seasonal performance assessment
- Generation of performance heatmaps and bias maps
- Customizable analysis parameters
